Above is the github for what i have so far with my website ideas. This is the basic idea for what i want it to be layed out. I plan on adding a color scheme, and linking the artists sites within the table. I want to add a section for upcoming shows and link those in as well. I am open to any other ideas as well as any tips on how to spruce up this site.

TO DO LIST:
Add More Color,
Add a mailing list button,
Link to artists websites,
link to venues in the area,
Add new venues to the site,
make the site easy to navigate with more interactive features,
try to add music to the site, 
add a suggested artists link,
figure out how to link within table
